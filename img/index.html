				<h3>Choose your favourite machine learning method, receive WIFI signal and get your location!</h3>
               			<p>Indoor position information is becoming more and more important in our daily life, its
application including tracking and monitoring of patients in the hospital, navigating in
 complex shopping plaza. However, GPS is less accurate when the space is not
 relatively empty or the high-rise buildings are dense. Therefore, wireless indoor
 positioning technology has developed rapidly. Especially, localization technique based
 on WIFI fingerprinting has attracted much attention due to its wide deployment and low cost. <br><br>
In this project, we will develop a indoor positioning system based on the UJIIndoorLoc
 database and hopefully it can successful migrate to any newly-collected dataset. In
 order to do that, several machine learning algorithms would be tested, combined and
 improved to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based
 method. </p>

connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. As such, it is 
different from recurrent neural networks. The feedforward neural 
network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network 
devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, 
forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and 
to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

 -->				<p>In computer science, Decision tree learning uses a decision tree (as a 
predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented 
in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value 
(represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling 
approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree 
models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are 
called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent 
class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead 
to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take 
continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.

                    Then after 911 attack, this pattern had changed due to security issues,
                    as the percentage of the total number of flights departed from
                    large-sized airports dropped, and more service was offered
                    to flights departed from medium-sized and small-sized airports. </p>

                <h3>To get a closer look,</h3>
                We were also interested in studying how individual companies were
                affected with 911. We first studied how individual companies changed
                their supply to accommodate the changes in consumer trust. Then
                we analyze how the profits were affected in the following years.

				<br /><br />We found something interesting.

				<h3>Growth in AA's supply and demand not expected.</h3>
				<p>After 911 attack,all airline companies had their number of
					passengers and seats decreased to varying degrees except AA.
					Actually AA made a great jump in the number of both passengers
					and seats, which seems strange considering that AA was
					directly involved in 911. We later took a look at AA's
					revenue report around 2001 and found the possible reason.</p>

				<h3>US Airways disproportionately affected</h3>
				<p>US Airways experienced a severe and long-lasting decrease
					in number of both passengers and seats. US Airways was
					the largest airline company at Washington National Airport
					which was directly involved in 911 attack. After the
					attack, Bush administration shut the airport down
					indefinitely and it was closed for more than 3 weeks.
					It accelerated the financial crisis of US Airways and
					resulted in the closure of the airline's MetroJet network,
					which was an important reason for US Airways's bankruptcy.</p>

				<h3>AA declared bankruptcy, due to poor purchases and post 911 travel scare </h3>
				<p>AA had a badly timed purchase of Trans World Airlines Inc.
                    In April 2001 came just as the U.S. economy was beginning to slow,
                    a decline that became much steeper after the Sept. 11, 2001,
                    terrorist attacks. The aftermath of Sept. 11 left the industry
                    and American reeling as the number of people traveling plummeted
                    and spent the first half of the decade skirting Bankruptcy Court.
                    Similarly, other airlines such as UA, Delta, Northwest, though
                    some of them are not directly involved with 911, have filed for
                    bankruptcy starting in 2002 to stay alive.

				<h3>Low budget airlines, Southwest Airlines, were able to maintain profits over the years</h3>
				<p>The impact of 911 was indeed a catalyst for major airline companies’
                    bankruptcies. However, after looking at the stats for Southwest
                    Airlines, we are further confirmed that a strong recovery from
                    911 was possible and that the companies who suffered from
                    economic misery after 911 were mostly due to some extent of
                    poor management. Delta, Northwest, AA and UA emerged from bankruptcy
                    a few years later with lower pay and benefits for employees,
                    trimmer workforces and often with better terms on airplanes,
                    facilities and debt, successfully rebounded to make stable
                    profits after 2010.
